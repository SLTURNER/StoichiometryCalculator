# MoleculeMassAmountCalc

  The purpose of this website is to quickly calculate the how much of a substance is needed for a specific reaction to take place.
  The hope is that students can use this website, to gain a better grasp of the chemistry, and allow them to focus on the theory of their course.

  This calculator should NOT be used for meaningful research, as it does NOT take significant digits into consideration.
